Represented as a 128-bit number, it is widely used as an identifier that is virtually impossible to duplicate. A key feature is the ability to generate unique IDs independently anywhere without a central management server."

          "title": "UUID v4 Characteristics",
          "content": "UUID v4, generated by this tool, is created based on random values. Theoretically, the probability of collision (generating the same value) is extremely low and practically negligible. Even generating 1 billion UUIDs per second, the probability of collision would not reach 50% even after 100 years."
